## Development background
Initially, I created it as part of learning OpenID Connect. I thought it would be a waste not to use them during the process, so I decided to create a service that uses the Authorization Code Grant, Client Credentials Grant, and Refresh Token Grant. I selected the LGTM image generator as a service that can be developed quickly and has three types of flows available.
